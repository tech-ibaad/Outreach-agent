## Background
- Business context: <add your company/offer and target personas here>
- Outreach tone: <friendly/consultative/direct>, include compliance/opt-out requirements if any.

## Data Sources
- Notion will store leads; the team must confirm the correct database id before writes.

## Safety & Approvals
- Require user approval for: database selection, lead insert/update, and any email send.
- Do not embed API keys in messages; load from environment only.
