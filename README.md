# Lead Search & Outreach Agency

Find qualified leads, store them in your chosen Notion database, and send outreach via Resend — always with your approval on database selection, lead saves, and email sends.

## Agents
- LeadSearchAgent — discovers and vets leads with web search, summarizes candidates, and hands off approved leads.
- OutreachAgent — manages Notion lead records and Resend email delivery, enforcing approvals and dedupe checks.

## Tools
- WebSearchTool (built-in) for discovery.
- NotionDatabaseTool (custom) for listing, querying, reading, creating, and updating Notion records.
- ResendEmailTool (custom) for single or batch send, update, cancel, and attachment retrieval.

## Use cases
- Generate and approve lead lists before saving them to Notion.
- List databases, pick the right one, and add or update specific leads.
- Draft and send single or batch outreach emails through Resend with explicit sign-off.
- Update scheduled send times, cancel queued emails, and log status back to Notion.
